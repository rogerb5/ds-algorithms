# linked list values

Return all the values within the linked list in order

a->b-c->d

Traversing in order iterative

values: []

a -> b -> c -> d
^
c

First, current is equal to the head
then make current = current.next
Add the value into the collection, and so forth.

values: [a]

a -> b -> c -> d
     ^
   c.next


values: [a, b, c]

a -> b -> c -> d
          ^
       c.next


values: [a, b, c, d]

a -> b -> c -> d
               ^
            c.next 

When current equals null that is when we finish traversing
and it is the end of the linked list!

values: [a, b, c, d]

a -> b -> c -> d -> /
                    ^
                    c
