Write a function tribonacci that takes in a number argument, n, and returns the n-th number of the Tribonacci sequence.

The 0-th and 1-st numbers of the sequence are both 0.

The 2-nd number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous three numbers.

Solve this recursively.

Test 00:
tribonacci(0) # -> 0

Test 01:
tribonacci(1) # -> 0

Test 02:
tribonacci(2) # -> 1

Test 03:
tribonacci(5) # -> 4

Test 04:
tribonacci(7) # -> 13

Test 05:
tribonacci(14) # -> 927

Test 06:
tribonacci(20) # -> 35890

Test 07:
tribonacci(37) # -> 1132436852
