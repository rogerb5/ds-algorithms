Write a function, summing_squares, that takes a target number as an argument. The function should return the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to the target. A perfect square is a number of the form (i*i) where i >= 1.

For example: 1, 4, 9, 16 are perfect squares, but 8 is not perfect square.

Given 12:

summing_squares(12) -> 3

The minimum squares required for 12 is three, by doing 4 + 4 + 4.

Another way to make 12 is 9 + 1 + 1 + 1, but that requires four perfect squares.

Test 00:
summing_squares(8) # -> 2

Test 01:
summing_squares(9) # -> 1

Test 02:
summing_squares(12) # -> 3

Test 03:
summing_squares(1) # -> 1

Test 04:
summing_squares(31) # -> 4

Test 05:
summing_squares(50) # -> 2

Test 06:
summing_squares(68) # -> 2

Test 07:
summing_squares(87) # -> 4
